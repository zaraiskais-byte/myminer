/**
 * A compact, lazily-decoded view of one module's VLQ `mappings` for the
 * generated -> original position lookup that `/symbolicate` performs.
 *
 * Construction builds a per-line index: one entry per generated line holding the
 * byte offset into `mappings` where that line's segments begin and the
 * source-line/source-column delta accumulators as they stand entering the line.
 * A lookup jumps to the target line and decodes only that line's segments in
 * place over the retained `mappings` string, allocating nothing.
 *
 * VLQ deltas are cumulative across the whole string, so the index snapshots the
 * accumulator state at each line start to make any line independently
 * decodable. The index holds O(lines) integers; generated columns reset per
 * line and are not stored.
