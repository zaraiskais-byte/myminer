 * `ScrollView` simply renders all its react child components at once. That
 * makes it very easy to understand and use.
 *
 * On the other hand, this has a performance downside. Imagine you have a very
 * long list of items you want to display, maybe several screens worth of
 * content. Creating JS components and native views for everything all at once,
 * much of which may not even be shown, will contribute to slow rendering and
 * increased memory usage.
 *
 * This is where `FlatList` comes into play. `FlatList` renders items lazily,
 * just when they are about to appear, and removes items that scroll way off
 * screen to save memory and processing time.
 *
 * `FlatList` is also handy if you want to render separators between your items,
 * multiple columns, infinite scroll loading, or any number of other features it
 * supports out of the box.
